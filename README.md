# Tanja Tattoo / GodArt Tattoo - Full Stack Training Platform

![Tanja Tattoo Academy](media/readme_images/logo.jpg) 

**Tanja Tattoo / GodArt Tattoo** is a comprehensive, production-ready Full Stack platform for online tattoo art training. This project provides an immersive and interactive learning experience for students, complemented by a powerful, custom-built administrative panel that gives the mentor complete control over the educational content, student management, and overall platform operations.

The platform was developed with a strong focus on high-quality UI/UX, robust performance through optimized database queries, and the automation of routine tasks to create a seamless experience for both students and administrators.

Over 200 hours were invested in this project. It was made with passion.

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

* **User-Centric Design:** Every feature, from the sales funnel to the learning dashboard, is designed to be intuitive and engaging.
* **Automation & Efficiency:** Repetitive tasks, such as sending notifications and updating statuses, are fully automated to allow the mentor to focus on teaching, not administration.
* **Performance First:** Database interactions are carefully optimized using advanced Django ORM techniques to ensure a fast and responsive experience, even with a large number of users and lessons.
* **Seamless Integration:** The platform tightly integrates with external services like Stripe, Telegram, and Mailjet to create a unified and professional ecosystem.

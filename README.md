![Tanja Tattoo Academy](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpxuxiswa/image/upload/v1754326032/logo_hqeenn.jpg))

**Tanja Tattoo / GodArt Tattoo** is a comprehensive, production-ready Full Stack platform for online tattoo art training. Developed as a commercial project for a real-world client, this application was built to be deployed in a live production environment on **Render**. This document provides a detailed overview of the project, with a special focus on its backend architecture, business logic, and API integrations. The project combines an intuitive user interface with a powerful, custom-built administrative panel, all powered by a robust and scalable backend.

Over 200 hours were invested in this project. It was made with passion.

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

* **User-Centric Design:** Every feature, from the sales funnel to the learning dashboard, is designed to be intuitive and engaging for the end-user.
* **Automation & Efficiency:** The backend is designed to automate repetitive tasks, such as sending notifications and updating statuses, allowing the mentor to focus on teaching, not administration.
* **Performance First:** Backend performance is critical. Database interactions are carefully optimized using advanced Django ORM techniques to ensure a fast and responsive experience, even with a large number of users and lessons.
* **Seamless Integration:** The platform's backend tightly integrates with external services like Stripe, Telegram, and Mailjet to create a unified and professional ecosystem.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Highlights & Key Logic

This project incorporates several advanced backend features to ensure robustness, scalability, and a superior user experience:

* **Custom User Model & Avatars:** The platform utilizes a custom Django User model that replaces the default `username` with `email` for a modern authentication experience. Users have the ability to upload and manage their own personal avatars.
* **Positional Numbering for Lectures:** To avoid data integrity issues from object deletion, all lectures are ordered using a dedicated `position_number` field. This allows the mentor to reliably reorder lessons via a simple API endpoint, independent of the database primary key.
**Automatic `last_activity` Tracking:** To monitor user engagement, the `last_activity` timestamp is updated upon every visit to the main Dashboard. This logic is handled within the view's `dispatch` method, providing an efficient way to track real-time activity in the admin panel.
* **Smart Chat System:** The chat's backend logic leverages `is_read_user` and `is_read_admin` boolean flags on the `Message` model. This allows for highly efficient database queries to calculate unread message counts and ensures notifications are triggered only when necessary.
* **Automated Webhook Development with Ngrok:** To facilitate local development and testing of incoming webhooks from services like Stripe and Telegram, the project uses a sophisticated, automated `ngrok` setup.
    * The `Dockerfile` handles the installation of `ngrok` directly into the container image.
    * On container startup, the `entrypoint.sh` script automatically starts an `ngrok` tunnel to expose the local port 8000.
    * The script then retrieves the public URL from the ngrok API and uses it to dynamically configure the application, for instance, by programmatically setting the `Telegram webhook`. This level of automation streamlines the development workflow significantly.

## üöÄ Installation & Launch

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill in all required variables (API keys, database settings, `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`, etc.). The `docker-compose.yaml` lists all required environment variables for the web service.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
This is the simplest way to start the application and its database service for local development.

1.  **Build and Run the Containers:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## üß™ Testing

The project is extensively covered by over **600 lines of tests** using the **Pytest** framework. Tests are focused on the backend, covering API endpoints, business logic, and model methods to ensure reliability.

To run the tests with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest
